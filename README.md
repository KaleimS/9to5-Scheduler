This project was fascinating, and I thoroughly enjoyed researching dayjs. Although I was initially lost, I persevered and gained a deeper understanding. As a result, my skills in Javascript and Jquery have significantly improved, and I am now more confident than ever. Despite having a long way to go, I am determined to continue pushing myself and see how far I can go.
